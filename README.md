# DevOps-Project
This is the second project
Here we have created three files:

1. Keerti.py
This file includes a simple print statement

2. Jenkinsfile
This is the file where we have provided instructions for our Jenkins file. There are three stages in the pipeline
 - Keerti - Build Docker Image
 - Keerti - Login to Dockerhub
 - Keerti - Push image to Dockerhub
 
 3. Dockerfile
 This file has instructions to create a docker image from our Keerti.py file.
